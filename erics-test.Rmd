Eric's example
========================================================

Minimal example taken from Yihui Xie [001-minimal.Rmd] (https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/001-minimal.Rmd) from his github repository.

## code chunks

A _paragraph_ here. A code chunk below (remember the three backticks):

```{r}
1+1
.4-.7+.3 # what? it is not zero!
```

## graphics

It is easy. Obligatory scatterplot and histogram.

```{r}
plot(1:10, runif(10), pch=3, cex=2)
hist(rnorm(1000))
```

## inline code

Yes I know the value of pi is `r pi`, and 2 times pi is `r 2*pi`.

## math

Sigh. You cannot live without math equations. OK, here we go: $\alpha+\beta=\gamma$. Note this is not supported by native markdown. 


### Conclusion
So, this concludes the example of building a document that contains narrative and code.
